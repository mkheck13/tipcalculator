### Peer Review:
**Name**: Aidan Younathan

**Comments**: The functions of this work good when you input numbers but the input fields you have also take in letters so I would reccomend changing that to a number input and adding that keydown event I posted in chat, it looks good for the most part, the only thing is that on desktop the right side box is a little short but this is a really good effort! Good Job!

**Update**: Made changes that the reviewer suggested.
